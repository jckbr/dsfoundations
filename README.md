This repo contains different data science examples learned from a university class in Summer 2021

Each folder has a readme.md file explaining what the code in the folder does

***

Even though Summer 2021 was the first time this class was offered at my university, I really enjoyed it and wish I had more time to take classes similar to it. Another class I would have enjoyed would be Deep Learning since it would pair well with this class, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence classes

The ideas learned in this class also paired well with the [appliedml](https://github.com/jckbr/appliedml) class I took at the same time and later [theoryofai](https://github.com/jckbr/theoryofai) taken most recently in Winter 2022

Concepts/libraries demonstrated:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Link Pandas DataFrames
- XML and JSON file parsing
- Neural networks (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras)
- kMeans clustering (Scikit-Learn)
- Matplotlib
